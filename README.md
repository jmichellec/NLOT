# Data analysis project - Netherlands Office Taipei

This project was part of my internship at the Netherlands Office Taipei. Research focused on (economic/innovative) strengths and weaknesses of Netherlands & Taiwan, and their trade relations. Insights were visualised using Tableau.

## Data
All data is open source.
- CBS data (import, dependencies)
- Taiwan Trade Office data (export); uses Python script (TW_data-preprocessing.py) to preprocess data. Columns with exchange rate is added manually.
- Patents from Lens.org, counted by simple families; uses Python script to aggregate the families
