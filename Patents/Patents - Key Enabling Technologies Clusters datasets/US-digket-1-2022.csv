An end-effector of the mechanism is connected to linkages and to a joining tool, unactuated joints interconnect the linkages, and position sensors measure joint positions of the unactuated joints. In response to the joint positions, a controller regulates a position of the actuated joints to cause the compliance mechanism to compliantly follow the assembly line. This occurs while the tool remains engaged with a workpiece being transported along the assembly line. A method includes engaging the tool with the workpiece as the workpiece is transported by the assembly line, measuring joint positions of the unactuated joints using position sensors, and controlling a position of the active joints to cause the compliance mechanism to compliantly follow the workpiece along the assembly line.",GM GLOBAL TECH OPERATIONS LLC,ABDALLAH MUHAMMAD E;;WELLS JAMES W,GM GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS LLC (2022-01-11),https://lens.org/016-570-408-355-215,Granted Patent,yes,3,0,1,1,0,B23P21/004,B25J9/16;;B23P21/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
