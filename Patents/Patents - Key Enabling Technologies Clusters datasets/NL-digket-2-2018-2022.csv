The information identifying the starting location is used to identify a decoded starting segment of the mobile version of the digital map. Map information is accessed for assigning a cost value to segments of the digital map. A segment that satisfies the bloom filter is assigned a minimal cost value. A first decoded route is determined based on the cost value assigned to the segments. The first decoded route is a route from the decoded starting segment to a first POI.

Compared to techniques in which most or all of the processing is performed by the intermediary system, an advantage of continuing to process the video data at the receiver system is that the receiver system may already decode the video stream while the video stream is decoded and/or analyzed by the intermediary system, thereby reducing the delay from transmission to display of the video stream.",KONINKLIJKE KPN NV;;TNO,STOKKING HANS MAARTEN;;TER HAAR FRANK;;HINDRIKS HENDRIKUS NATHANIËL,KONINKLIJKE KPN N.V (2021-07-23);;NEDERLANDSE ORGANISATIE VOOR TOEGEPAST-NATUURWETENSCHAPPELIJK ONDERZOEK TNO (2021-07-23),https://lens.org/182-517-292-387-237,Patent Application,yes,5,0,3,3,0,H04N21/222;;H04N21/23418;;H04N21/4424;;H04N21/631;;H04N21/8547;;H04N21/23418;;H04N21/435,H04N21/234;;H04N21/435,,1,1,104-683-815-638-408,10.1145/3084363.3085083,"Christian Frueh, Avneesh Sud, and Vivek Kwatra; ""Headset Removal for Virtual and Mixed Reality"", Aug 3rd 2017, In Proceedings of SIGGRAPH ’17 Talks, Los Angeles, CA, USA, July 30 - August 03, 2017 (Year: 2017)",DISCONTINUED

The image is segmented to represent either a pore space or solid material in the rock. An image porosity is estimated from the segmented image, and a corrected porosity is determined to account for the sub-resolution porosity missing in the image of the rock.

The second node does receive more data than just the identifier of the current state and can assess the validity of the intended state transition.

The approach further involves, for each grid cell, detecting directional groupings of the probe data. The directional groupings comprise probes of the probe data that share a respective common direction of travel. The approach further involves detecting a set of grid cells with a count of the directional groupings that is above a count threshold. The approach further involves designating an area associated with the set of grid cells as an unconstrained area or a sub-area of the unconstrained area.

The invention provides simulation data corresponding to full-waveform signals of CW lidar sensors. The provided sensor data also allows to determine additional information, such as object shapes and object classes, and object orientation. Moreover, the sensor data also comprises artifacts which are present in real lidar data, which originate from physical properties of the lidar sensor and the environment and are absent in point-clouds- type data, such as multiple reflections of the lidar beam. Therefore, sensor development can be improved by also taking said artifacts into account. The invention accurately simulates how a real CW lidar sensor works and therefore accurately recreates the output of a real CW lidar sensor. The provided high-quality data, which is both complete and accurate to the real world, can also be of high value for developing signal processing algorithms, training neural networks, virtual validation, and the like.",SIEMENS IND SOFTWARE AND SERVICES B V,PHILLIPS MICHAEL,,https://lens.org/167-792-041-535-816,Patent Application,yes,3,1,8,8,0,G01S17/006;;G06T15/06;;G06F30/367;;G06F2111/08;;G01S7/48;;G06F30/367;;G01S17/006;;G06F2111/08;;G06F30/20;;G01S7/491;;G01S7/497,G06F30/20;;G01S17/00;;G06T15/06,,3,1,106-673-031-198-866,10.1117/12.849747,"ANGELA M.
