The approach may provide improved detection of resonance objects, such as smart cards (e.g. NFC cards).",KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS NV,ETTES WILHELMUS G M;;VELTMAN EDDY G;;VAN VUGT HENRICUS A G,,https://lens.org/054-337-837-744-486,Patent Application,no,0,0,12,12,0,H02J50/10;;H02J50/20;;H02J50/80;;H02J50/60;;H02J50/10;;H02J50/20;;H02J50/80;;H02J50/80;;H02J50/10;;H02J50/60;;H04B5/0037,H02J50/10;;H02J50/20;;H02J50/60;;H02J50/80,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The phase-noise in these oscillators influences the overall system performance. For instance phase-noise causes ""reciprocal mixing"" in receivers, whereby an adjacent channel during a frequency conversion or mixing is transferred to the wanted 20 channel. A lower phase-noise reduces the effect of reciprocal mixing and improves system performance. This document describes a system that reduces the phase-noise of an oscillator. 25 STATE OF THE ART The development of oscillators with low phase-noise is considered an important topic. Several ways for analysing oscillator phase-noise have been developed during the last decades, see for instance Reference [1]. Most importantly, the 30 oscillator swing should be maximised while noise generated by all components should be minimised in order to obtain maximum phase-noise performance. In most case the power consumption needs to be increased in order to meet the required phase-noise performance. In the case of f.i. ring-oscillators, the limited Q of the resonator limits the obtainable phase-noise such that this oscillator type 35 cannot be used in certain applications. In the majority of the applications, the requirements on phase-noise, tuning range, power consumption, etc is a multi- dimensional compromise. In most applications the oscillator is used in a phase-locked loop (PLL). The oscillator output signal is divided in frequency, and this frequency divided signal is 40 compared to a reference frequency. The differente signal is fed back to the oscillator. When the PLL is locked, the overall phase-noise within the feedback loop bandwidth is governed by the phase-noise of the reference signal, while outside 1042961 1042961",ZELECTRONIX HOLDING BV,DR IR PAULUS THOMAS MARIA VAN ZEIJL,,https://lens.org/139-029-283-459-540,Granted Patent,no,6,0,1,1,0,H04B1/10;;H03B5/00;;H03L7/00,H04B1/10;;H03B5/00;;H03L7/00,,0,0,,,,INACTIVE

An NFC reader sends requests or other commands to stimulate a response from a PICC that may be in the operating area, and the presence of a PICC is determined based upon the signal strength for the subcarrier. For one embodiment, the subcarrier signal strength is compared to background values measured without stimulus to determine if a PICC is present in the operating area. As such, the presence of a PICC is detectable even where NFC communication with a PICC is unsuccessful because the PICC response is corrupted or not detectable due to interference.

The system comprising a frequency-offset-correction-block; and a sub-band-demapping-block. The sub-band-demapping-block is configured to receive an input-signal and determine within the input signal: one or more allocated-frequency-sub-bands allocated to convey an information-signal (PSS, SSS and BCH); and one or more unallocated-frequency-sub-bands.

Even though in Sidelink synchronization subframes there is no data allocated to the neighbouring unallocated-subcarriers, a frequency-offset-correction block can use them to improve the frequency offset robustness of BCH decoding. The reason is that in case of frequency-offset-error, energy leaks onto these unallocated-subcarriers. By including them in a frequency offset correction input, the energy that leaked onto them can advantageously be harvested. As a result, the BCH decoding performance can be improved substantially.",NXP BV,MARTINEZ VINCENT PIERRE,,https://lens.org/078-816-027-022-237,Patent Application,yes,1,1,4,4,0,H04L27/0014;;H04L27/2647;;H04L27/2656;;H04L2027/0026;;H04L27/2657;;H04L27/2672;;H04L27/2675;;H04L27/2688;;H04L5/0044;;H04L27/2656;;H04L27/2659;;H04L27/2675,H04L27/26,,1,1,062-037-628-445-899,10.1109/vetecf.2004.1405011,"ZHENG SHANG ET AL: ""A novel frequency synchronization method for wireless OFDM systems"", 2004 IEEE 60TH VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY CONFERENCE.

The first gated diode can be implemented with an analogous second gated diode to form ESD-protection circuitry for the integrated circuit.",NXP BV,HONG CHEONG MIN;;YIN CHUNSHAN;;CHEN YU,NXP B.V (2018-09-05),https://lens.org/159-854-430-552-952,Patent Application,yes,2,1,6,6,0,H01L27/0255;;H01L27/0255;;H01L29/8611;;H01L27/0255;;H01L29/66356;;H01L29/7391,H01L29/739;;H01L27/02;;H01L29/66,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

The receiver signal power is compared with a threshold noise power based on an estimate of the thermal noise of the radar receiver to determine whether the receiver signal corresponds to an interfered received chirp including interference or a non-interfered received chirp not including interference.",NXP BV,JANSEN FEIKE;;LAGHEZZA FRANCESCO,NXP B.V (2018-10-31),https://lens.org/198-958-919-450-573,Granted Patent,yes,36,0,5,5,0,G01S7/021;;G01S7/023;;G01S7/352;;G01S7/023;;G01S7/354;;G01S13/343;;G01S13/345;;G01S13/42;;G01S13/931;;H04B1/1027;;G01S7/356;;G01S7/023;;G01S7/36;;G01S13/345;;G01S7/356;;G01S7/354,G01S7/35;;G01S7/02;;G01S7/36;;G01S13/34,,2,2,034-902-886-352-343;;162-820-778-788-854,10.23919/irs.2017.8008126;;10.1049/ip-f-2.1992.0048,"Bechter et al., “Estimation and Cancellation of Interferences in Automotive Radar Signals,” the 18th International Radar Symposium IRS 2017, Jun. 28-30, 2017, 10 pages.;;Stove, A.G., “Linear FMCW Radar Techniques,” IEE Proceedings-F, vol. 139, No. 5, Oct. 1992, 8 pages.",ACTIVE

If not so, the processor determines a second protocol indication and a second channel indication indicating at least one further channel to be used for the new connection and sends a second handover request message.

During prolonged sequences of zeros (or ones), the driving current is switched to keep the radiation output level between a certain minimum and maximum level. This range of radiation output levels is adaptively selected in accordance with characteristics of the driving current, the optical transmission channel, the radiation source and/or the radiation detector.",SIGNIFY HOLDING BV,LINNARTZ JOHAN;;VAN VOORTHUISEN PAUL,,https://lens.org/081-110-823-020-957,Search Report,yes,1,0,2,2,0,H04B10/116;;H04B10/502,H04B10/116;;H04B10/50,,1,1,028-598-333-255-219,10.1109/comst.2015.2417576,"DILUKSHAN KARUNATILAKA ET AL: ""LED Based Indoor Visible Light Communications: State of the Art"", IEEE COMMUNICATIONS SURVEYS & TUTORIALS, 1 January 2015 (2015-01-01), New York, pages 1649 - 1678, XP055235928, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://www.researchgate.net/profile/R_Parthiban/publication/277659619_LED_Based_Indoor_Visible_Light_Communications_State_of_the_Art/links/55e41c0c08aecb1a7cc9e8ad.pdf?inViewer=0&pdfJsDownload=0&origin=publication_detail> [retrieved on 20151214], DOI: 10.1109/COMST.2015.2417576",PENDING

In an encoding method, depth values and occupancy data are both encoded into a depth map. The method adapts how the depth values and occupancy data are converted to map values in the depth map. For example, it may adaptively select a threshold, above or below which all values represent unoccupied pixels. By adapting how the depth and occupancy are encoded, based on analysis of the depth values, the method can enable more effective encoding and transmission of the depth data and occupancy data. The encoding method outputs metadata defining the adaptive encoding. This metadata can be used by a corresponding decoding method, to decode the map values. Also provided are an encoder and a decoder for depth data, and a corresponding bitstream, comprising a depth map and its associated metadata.

In an encoding method, depth values and occupancy data are both encoded into a depth map. The method adapts how the depth values and occupancy data are converted to map values in the depth map. For example, it may adaptively select a threshold, above or below which all values represent unoccupied pixels.

The combined fifth coefficient of thermal expansion may be between the first coefficient of thermal expansion and the second coefficient of thermal expansion. The attachment layer (20) may have a combined fifth elastic modulus, being lower than the fourth elastic modulus. The combined fifth elastic modulus may be in a range between the third elastic modulus and the fourth elastic modulus, for example, the fifth elastic modulus may depend on the weight and/or the volume of the attachment material (22) relative to the weight and/or the volume of the mesh (21). The mesh (21) may be a wire mesh, such as a net or netting, intertwined structure and/or network structure. The mesh (21) may be partly or fully embedded in the attachment material (22). The mesh (21) may be in physical contact with the substrate (10). The mesh (21) may be an integrated part of the substrate (10), preferably wherein the mesh (21) is formed from protruding parts of the substrate (10) after removing, such as galvanically growing, milling or etching away, parts of the substrate (10). The mesh (21) may extend beyond a die attachment surface facing the attachment. The mesh (21) may be smaller than the die attachment surface, preferably forming a region and/or an island where the combined fifth coefficient of thermal expansion is locally adapted and/or the combined fifth elastic modulus is locally adapted, advantageously allowing the mesh (21) and/or the attachment layer (20) as a whole to be adapted to the expected amount of heat generated at a particular location in the die (30), more specific to a hot spot of the die (30). The mesh (21) may comprise mechanical parts, such as springs and/or hinges, configured for recovering its original shape when released after deformation and/or reinforcements for relieving and/or reducing thermal expansion tension in the attachment layer (20). The mesh (21) may comprise one or more of copper, nickel, tungsten, tungsten copper alloy, CuW, iron, FeNi, molybdenum and polyimide, or an alloy one or more of the previously mentioned materials. The mesh (21) is designed by identifying the hot spot location of a hot spot of the die (30); and adapting the mesh (21) based on the hot spot location. The adapting may comprise: shrinking the opening area of the mesh (21) relative to the area of the mesh (21) when projected from above at the location of the hot spot; and/or enlarging the opening area of the mesh (21) relative to the area of the mesh (21) when projected from above at the location away from the hot spot. The die (30) may have an operational die temperature, wherein the method for manufacturing the integrated circuit may comprise curing the attachment layer (20) after arranging the die (10) on top of the attachment layer (20), wherein the curing is performed at a curing temperature between the operational temperature and room temperature.
