As the price decreases with the total amount, buyers have positive externalities that allow them to obtain lower prices than they would otherwise be able to get individually (Chen and Roma 2011, 181).Although collective buying has been widely used for business-to-business and business-to-consumer transactions (Chen and Roma 2011, 181), there is an underlying problem with the use of discount vouchers as they can call into question the reliability that the minimum number of buyers will make the purchase. In practice, once discount vouchers have been delivered, the minimum order quantity set by the seller is significantly greater than the aggregated quantity purchased.CollectiveBuying.io (CB) discovered new processes that are unique and valuable improvements to the traditional collective buying model. CB’s techniques solve existing problems, can adapt to find fast solutions, and can prevent future problems. In the problem mentioned previously, CB’s cryptographic methods provide a means by which the buyers demonstrate a Commitment-to-Purchase to increase the aggregated quantity purchased. In addition, CB’s improved model operates on blockchain cryptography to provide buyers with the additional benefits of authentication, authorization, anonymization, and accountability.CB is a method for use in the practice, administration, and management of economic models; the processing of financial data; and when determining the exchange of goods or services. Furthermore, CB is a model, a design, a process, and an improvement for data subject to authentication, authorization, anonymization, and other security through techniques such as digital rights management, encryption, tokenization, biometrics, device profiling, localization, timing, risk or fraud assessment, distributed ledger transactions, cryptocurrency transactions, software licensing, and voting (United States Patent and Trademark Office [USPTO]).",BEARD DAVID ARNOLD,BEARD DAVID ARNOLD,,https://lens.org/101-781-708-151-178,Patent Application,yes,1,0,1,1,0,G06Q30/0609;;G06Q30/0207;;G06Q30/0609;;G06Q30/0207,G06Q30/02;;G06Q30/06,,0,0,,,,PENDING
