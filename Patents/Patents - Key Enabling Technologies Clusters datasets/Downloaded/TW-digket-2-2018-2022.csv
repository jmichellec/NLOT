The switch extracts data of the in-tunnel flow when the data is transmitted among computers that run software switches over the virtual network. The switch conducts monitoring, metering and management of the in-tunnel flows. A virtual machine running in a computer generates a packet that is encapsulated through a tunnel protocol at a logical port. The packet is then transmitted to the switch. The switch uses the flow tables to perform packet lookups for extracting the in-tunnel flow after the packet is de-capsulated. The packet is then re-encapsulated and forwarded to a logical port of the switch that connects to a destination computer. The destination computer can acquire the original packet after de-capsulating the packet.",ESTINET TECH INC;;UNIV NATIONAL CHIAO TUNG,WANG SHIE-YUAN;;LIN MIN-YAN,ESTINET TECHNOLOGIES INC (2018-07-24);;NATIONAL CHIAO TUNG UNIVERSITY (2018-07-24),https://lens.org/121-184-470-161-236,Patent Application,yes,0,10,3,3,0,H04L47/2483;;H04L63/0272;;H04L12/4633;;H04L12/4633;;H04L12/4633;;H04L12/4641;;H04L12/4641;;H04L12/4641;;H04L43/026;;H04L47/2441;;H04L47/2441;;H04L47/2483;;H04L49/201;;H04L49/25;;H04L49/354;;H04L49/70;;H04L63/0464;;H04L69/22;;H04L69/22;;H04L2012/4629,H04L12/851;;H04L12/46;;H04L12/931;;H04L29/06,,0,0,,,,DISCONTINUED

The intermediate result of query is minimized and the performance is further improved. The present invention uses multiple indexes, where all possible combined-index orders are considered and the best combined index is selected according to different query adaptabilities. As a result, the structure has a high chance of saving query time at a rate of more than 25 times as compared to a structure with indexes of a single attribute sequence.

A first repayment in the repayment plan of the first step is related to repayment of interest without the principal with respect to the total debt and a second repayment in the repayment plan of the second step is related to repayment of interest with the principal with respect to the total debt. The repayment amount withdrawn from a repayment account is determined depending on the debt ratio of each credit bank. The repayment account is used to store the refund amount of the first or second repayment and the purchase amount of money. Therefore, debt can be more easily managed. To this end, the present invention comprises: a plurality of credit bank servers; a carrier providing server; at least one consumer terminal; an account management server; and a repayment distribution server.",HSU CHIA YEH,HSU CHIA YEH,,https://lens.org/070-852-554-793-276,Patent Application,no,4,0,9,10,0,G06Q40/02;;G06Q20/102;;G06Q20/405;;G06Q20/24;;G06Q40/02;;G06Q20/08;;G06Q20/24;;G06Q20/102,G06Q40/02;;G06Q20/08,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
