An end-effector of the mechanism is connected to linkages and to a joining tool, unactuated joints interconnect the linkages, and position sensors measure joint positions of the unactuated joints. In response to the joint positions, a controller regulates a position of the actuated joints to cause the compliance mechanism to compliantly follow the assembly line. This occurs while the tool remains engaged with a workpiece being transported along the assembly line. A method includes engaging the tool with the workpiece as the workpiece is transported by the assembly line, measuring joint positions of the unactuated joints using position sensors, and controlling a position of the active joints to cause the compliance mechanism to compliantly follow the workpiece along the assembly line.",GM GLOBAL TECH OPERATIONS LLC,ABDALLAH MUHAMMAD E;;WELLS JAMES W,GM GLOBAL TECHNOLOGY OPERATIONS LLC (2022-01-11),https://lens.org/016-570-408-355-215,Granted Patent,yes,3,0,1,1,0,B23P21/004,B25J9/16;;B23P21/00,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

A disclosed method, in which all steps are computer-implemented, includes receiving, using an imager moving along a crop row, at least one image of at least a portion of the crop row. The method also includes using the at least one image, a plant detection model, and an average inter-crop spacing for the crop row to generate an output from the plant detection model. The plant detection model is spacing aware in that the output of the plant detection model is altered or overridden based on the average inter-crop spacing. The method also includes outputting a control signal for the robotic action based on the output from the biased plant detection model. The method also includes conducting the robotic action for the agricultural task in response to the control signal.",FARMWISE LABS INC,PALOMARES THOMAS;;JAVAULT MICHAEL;;CONDINO MATTHEW;;MA YU NUNG,FARMWISE LABS INC (2022-06-18),https://lens.org/192-282-798-455-902,Granted Patent,yes,0,0,1,1,0,G06T7/00;;A01B39/18;;A01M21/00;;G06V20/188;;G06V10/82;;A01B79/005;;G06T1/0014;;G06V10/764;;G06V20/188,A01B79/00;;G06T1/00;;G06V10/764;;G06V20/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Each unit securely transmits the fused map and pollutant source data to one or more servers that compile a complete 3D map of the geographical area overlaid with pollution data which is updated in real time, and also notify relevant third parties to action pollutant sources within the area. The system can further comprise a plurality of smart light poles for displaying pollution data and advisory notices to citizens within sub-regions of the area.",KHEDEKAR PRATHAMESH,KHEDEKAR PRATHAMESH,,https://lens.org/195-172-556-738-637,Granted Patent,yes,8,1,1,1,0,B64C39/024;;G06V20/17;;G06V10/82;;G06Q50/26;;G06V10/803;;G06Q10/06395;;G06Q10/0635;;B64U2101/35;;B64U50/19;;B64U2101/30;;B64U2201/104;;G01N1/2273;;G01N15/02;;G01N15/06;;G01N2001/021;;G01N33/0075;;H04Q9/00;;G01W1/08;;B64C39/024;;G06V20/17;;G16Y20/10;;G16Y40/10;;B64U50/19;;B64U2101/30;;B64U2101/35;;B64U2201/10,G01W1/08;;B64C39/02;;G06V20/17;;G16Y20/10;;G16Y40/10,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE
