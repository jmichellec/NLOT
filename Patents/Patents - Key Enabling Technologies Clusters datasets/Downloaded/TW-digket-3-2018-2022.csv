These small differences can cause bitlines within the memory storage device to be physically unique with no two bitlines being identical. As a result, the uncontrollable random physical processes in the semiconductor fabrication process can cause electronic data read from the memory storage device to propagate along the bitlines at different rates.

Often times, manufacturing variations and/or misalignment tolerances present within the semiconductor fabrication process can cause the memory storage device to differ from other memory storage devices similarly designed and fabricated by the semiconductor fabrication process. For example, uncontrollable random physical processes in the semiconductor fabrication process can cause small differences, such as differences in doping concentrations, oxide thicknesses, channel lengths, structural widths, and/or parasitics to provide some examples, between these memory storage devices. These small differences can cause bitlines within the memory storage device to be physically unique with no two bitlines being identical. As a result, the uncontrollable random physical processes in the semiconductor fabrication process can cause electronic data read from the memory storage device to propagate along the bitlines at different rates. This physical uniqueness of the bitlines can be utilized to implement a physical unclonable function (PUF) allowing the memory storage device to be differentiated from other memory storage devices similarly designed and fabricated by the semiconductor fabrication process.",TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MFG CO LTD,TSAI JUI-CHE;;LEE CHENG HUNG;;LU SHIH-LIEN LINUS;;CHEN YI-JU,TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING CO.

For example, uncontrollable random physical processes in the semiconductor manufacturing process can cause small differences such as differences in doping concentrations, oxide thicknesses, channel lengths, structural widths, and/or parasitic components to provide several examples between the memory storage devices. The small differences can cause bit lines in the memory storage device to be physically unique while two bit lines are not identical. As a result, the uncontrollable random physical processes in the semiconductor manufacturing process can cause electronic data read from the memory storage device to propagate along the bit lines at different rates. The physical uniqueness of the bit lines can be used to realize a physically unclonable function (PUF) allowing the memory storage device to be differentiated from other memory storage devices similarly designed and manufactured by the semiconductor manufacturing process.",TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MFG CO LTD,TSAI JUI CHE;;CHEN YI JU;;LEE CHENG HUNG;;LU SHIH LIEN LINUS,,https://lens.org/187-334-208-866-420,Patent Application,no,4,0,9,9,0,G11C7/06;;G11C7/1006;;G11C7/18;;G06F21/73;;G06F21/73;;G11C7/06;;G11C7/08;;G11C7/08;;G11C7/12;;G11C7/12;;G11C7/12;;G11C7/12;;G11C7/24;;G11C7/24;;G11C11/419;;H04L9/32;;H04L9/0866;;H04L9/3278;;H04L2209/12,G11C7/06;;G11C7/12;;G11C7/24,,0,0,,,,ACTIVE

Many 3D visualization techniques have been used for visualization of the internal structures of an organ. However, the visualization techniques are not capable of projecting an actual length and is capable of generating only a very distorted 3D luminal organ. This invention automatically calculates the shell of a 3D tubular object and divides the object into a plurality of segments based on the center line of the shell. Each segment is columnar and used as a basic operation unit to simply cut and open or notch the object to observe the internal structure. This makes it possible to visualize the internal structure of the object without distortion. In many medical applications, this can be used for diagnosis, planning of surgery, or stent placements, etc., and consequently improves the quality of healthcare significantly.SELECTED DRAWING: Figure 5A",CHEN CHAO CHENG;;CHEN CHAO YU,CHEN CHAO-CHENG;;CHEN CHAO-YU,,https://lens.org/013-628-350-643-600,Patent Application,no,0,0,5,5,0,G06T17/00;;G06T19/00;;G06T2219/008;;G06T2210/41;;G06T19/20;;G06T7/0012;;G06T2219/2008;;G06T2207/30028;;G06T2219/2016;;G06T7/10,A61B6/03,,0,0,,,,PENDING

The processing circuit executes steps outlined below. Operation-related data is stored in the storage circuit under a normal operation mode. The operation related data is stored in a host terminal. A first hash value is calculated according to the operation related data and is stored in a non-power-off area. A power of the non-power-off area is maintained to be turned on and a power of a power-off area is turned off under a lower power operation mode. The power is restored when the normal operation mode is restored and the operation related data is retrieved from the host terminal to calculate a second hash value. The first and the second hash values are compared such that the operation related data is determined to be valid and the electronic apparatus operates according to the operation related data when the first and the second hash values are matched.

However, all the existing visualization techniques generate highly distorted images of real objects. This invention provides direct manipulation based on the centerline of the object and visualization of the 3D internal structures of a tubular object without any noticeable distortion. For the first time ever, the lumens of a human colon is visualized as it is in reality. In many medical applications, this can be used for diagnosis, planning of surgery or stent placements, etc. and consequently improves the quality of healthcare significantly.
