In order to provide a facilitated visualization of a subject's interior structure, an object visualization device (10) is provided comprising an image supply (12), a data processor (14) and an output (16). The image supply provides a 2D X-ray image of the object and also 3D data of the object. The data processor registers the 3D data to the 2D X-ray image and detects a viewing direction of the 2D X-ray image. The data processor also determines a viewing direction for a matching view of the 3D data based on the viewing direction of the 2D X-ray image. The data processor generates a pair of stereoscopic images (24) of the 3D data for the determined viewing direction and combines the 2D X-ray image with one of the images of the pair of stereoscopic images resulting in an augmented first stereoscopic image (26), whereas the other one of the pair of stereoscopic images remains as a generated second stereoscopic image (28). The output provides the augmented first stereoscopic image and the generated second stereoscopic image as an enhanced pair (30) of stereoscopic images providing an augmented 3D view of the object. Although only one of the stereoscopic images is provided with the additional X-ray image content information, in the combined view by both eyes, the X-ray information is also transferred to the other non-modified image.

Characteristic of the invention is that it is based on a software application (A-APP) in the device that innovatively uses a secure part of the device (Secure Cryptographic Environment or SCE) to bind the signature to both the possession of the SCE and the secret knowledge of the user to the digital signature in such a way that the resulting digital signatures complies with regular digital signatures standards. In effect it is like the SCE has implemented a PIN that only allows access to the digital signature generation function after the user has correctly entered that whereas in reality the SCE is completely oblivious of the PIN. Part of the invention is letting a certificate issuer place the generated public keys in digital certificates together with user information. The invention also entails various applications of the method and system including the setup of a centralized authentication provider providing user authentication and the direct use of the setup of service providers to authenticate users and providing additional services including remote signing.

The processor identifies and extracts the interactive elements based on the data representative of the 2D application. The processor also translates the interactive elements to user interface features of a mixed reality display application. The processor further generates data for presenting the mixed reality display application and maps user input to commands for user control of the 2D application. The mixed reality application interface provides the mixed reality display application to a user as mixed reality. The control interface receives input from the user for the user interface features and provides the commands to the 2D application in order to control the 2D application. Hence, augmented reality interfaces are mapped to traditional 2D screen interfaces. This allows to integrate applications that only provided the interaction on a monitor with a mouse or the like to be operated in today's augmented reality environment.",KONINKLIJKE PHILIPS NV,KEENAN JR PHILIP;;FLEXMAN MOLLY;;MORY BENOIT;;PANSE ASHISH;;WEBB PENELOPE;;WICKY VAN DOYER ROMAN,,https://lens.org/183-852-318-193-292,Patent Application,yes,3,0,2,2,0,G06F3/011;;A61B34/25;;G06F3/017;;A61B2090/365;;A61B2090/502;;A61B2090/372;;A61B2090/376;;A61B2017/00216;;A61B2017/00207;;A61B2017/00203;;A61B90/36;;G02B27/0172;;G02B27/0093;;G02B27/00,G06F3/01;;A61B34/00;;A61B34/10;;A61B90/00;;G02B27/00;;G06T19/00;;G06T19/20,,1,1,019-564-787-381-250,29464292;;10.1007/s00113-018-0463-1,"ECK ULRICH ET AL: ""Display technologies for augmented reality in medical applications"", UNFALLCHIRURG, SPRINGER, BERLIN, DE, vol. 121, no. 4, 20 February 2018 (2018-02-20), pages 278 - 285, XP036468828, ISSN: 0177-5537, [retrieved on 20180220], DOI: 10.1007/S00113-018-0463-1",PENDING

A 3D-heatmap obtained with a method of the invention shows the amount of viewing time spent at a specific point on a surface of the virtual object, which is typically indicated by different colors. This allows for a marketeer, manufacturer, developer, teacher, etc. to quickly see how the user (for example a potential buyer or a student) navigates through the virtual environment and which aspects of the virtual object are of most interest for the usen",FECTAR B V,EUGÈNE ALOYS ADRIAAN KUIPERS-HOOGVELD;;LAURENTIUS GERARDUS ADRIANUS LENSVELT,,https://lens.org/154-010-014-882-993,Granted Patent,no,1,0,2,2,0,G06T19/003,G06T19/00,,2,2,014-338-549-086-873;;108-385-542-474-048,pmc7141050;;33828655;;10.16910/jemr.10.3.2;;10.1109/svr.2017.26,"HERMAN LUKAS ET AL: ""Eye-tracking Analysis of Interactive 3D Geovisualization"", JOURNAL OF EYE MOVEMENT RESEARCH, vol. 10, no. 3, 31 May 2017 (2017-05-31), XP055887089, Retrieved from the Internet <URL:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7141050/pdf/jemr-10-03-b.pdf> DOI: 10.16910/jemr.10.3.2;;SANTOS MARCEL ET AL: ""Analyzing AR Viewing Experience through Analytics Heat Maps for Augmented Content"", 2017 19TH SYMPOSIUM ON VIRTUAL AND AUGMENTED REALITY (SVR), IEEE, 1 November 2017 (2017-11-01), pages 137 - 145, XP033257919, DOI: 10.1109/SVR.2017.26",ACTIVE

The method comprises the steps of: - generating a virtual 3D-environment with a virtual 3D-object positioned in said virtual 3D-environment, the virtual 3D-object having a virtual 3D- surface; - providing a virtual camera movable within said virtual 3D-environment; - providing display means arranged in the real world for displaying the images captured by the virtual camera; - providing control means arranged in the real world for controlling, within the virtual 3D-environment, the movement of the virtual camera by a user; characterized by - during a time span in which movement of the virtual camera is controlled by the user repeating the steps of: o calculating the nearest point of intersection of the optical axis of the virtual camera with the virtual 3D-surface of the virtual 3D-object; o storing for each calculated point of intersection the accumulated amount of time during which the calculated point of intersection is intersected by the optical axis of the virtual camera; - after the time span has expired generating in the virtual 3D-environment a 3D-heatmap using the accumulated amount of time for each calculated point of intersection and the calculated point of intersection, wherein the 3D-heatmap is generated directly on the virtual 3D-surface of the virtual 3D-object. A 3D-heatmap obtained with a method of the invention shows the amount of viewing time spent at a specific point on a surface of the virtual object, which is typically indicated by different colors.

The data processing system includes a biometric sensor, a rich execution environment (REE), and a secure element (SE). In one embodiment, during an enrollment operation, a random challenge is applied to scanned data to produce a biometric template that is stored. During subsequent validation operations, the SE determines if user data includes evidence of the random challenge before providing access to a secure application.
